Angel's Rise is a 2D bullet hell built in Unity.
The scripts here are curated for review to showcase programming skills and design intent, including:
- Use of polymorphism for flexible upgrade systems
- Familiary with Unity's component-based architecture
- Management of player interactions, enemy behavior and AI, and animation control.

This is not the full game project. All scripts are selectively included to demonstrate programming proficiency.
